# VIQC 2023/24 Full Volume

## The Hero Robot Byte for the Game

### VEX Full Volume Hero Robot - Part 1

#### Some points to mention:

- Three parts / subsystems:
	- Drivetrain (or chassis) to move the robot
	- Arm to reach the blocks
	- Intake to pick up and release the blocks
 - 6 motors used, that's the max allowed for in the competition. So adding add. motor-driven functionality requires you to substitute existing motors.
 - Hitting a goal slightly sideways, allow you to square the robot up to the wall. Allows you to lining up the robot faster.
 - Robot can reach into the supply zone.
 - The arm can move more than 180 degrees
 - several design decisions to improve its pivot point and centre of mass.
 - the robot has several sensors to automate decisions when coding for autonomous driving.


### VEX Full Volume Hero Robot - Part 2

#### Some points to mention:

- The Byte robot can only handle two green and one purple block at a time. The red blocks are not supported.
- Speeding up the drivetrain?
- Size of the intake?
- online VEX Library


## Third Party Models

### Vacuum sweeper

### Analysing the robots

- Byte Robot and only the two robots here only handle green and purple blocks
- Spinning rollers for continuous operation
- 80 - 100 Point range for single robot operation.
- Review the rules for what you are focusing on. It may be impossible to do all tasks, even partially, so break down the tasks, and decide for the best mix.

## Engineering Handbook

An important part of the competition is the journaling of your activities when designing, building, and running your robot. All this should be kept in a centralized, structured document. [Here](https://kb.roboticseducation.org/hc/en-us/articles/8374007847575-Get-Started-Notebooking) you can find some descriptions on how to tackle this task.

The example below should give you an idea how to arrange your notes and what is worthwhile to record.

![Examples Notebook](https://viqrc-kb.recf.org/hc/en-us/articles/9760583053207-VEX-Engineering-Notebook-Examples)

We will create our notebook making Google Slides, [here] you find a template you can use. You can always use paper written notes, they will be scanned and you can then incorporate the pages into your electronic enginieering journal.
