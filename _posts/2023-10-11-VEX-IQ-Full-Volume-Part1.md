#### Some points to mention:

- Three parts / subsystems:
	- Drivetrain (or chassis) to move the robot
	- Arm to reach the blocks
	- Intake to pick up and release the blocks
 - 6 motors used, that's the max allowed for in the competition. So adding add. motor-driven functionality requires you to substitute existing motors.
 - Hitting a goal slightly sideways, allow you to square the robot up to the wall. Allows you to lining up the robot faster.
 - Robot can reach into the supply zone.
 - The arm can move more than 180 degrees
 - several design decisions to improve its pivot point and centre of mass.
 - the robot has several sensors to automate decisions when coding for autonomous driving.

#### Some points to mention:

- The Byte robot can only handle two green and one purple block at a time. The red blocks are not supported.
- Speeding up the drivetrain?
- Size of the intake?
- online VEX Library

#### Some points to mention:

- Robot only handles green and purple blocks
- Spinning rollers for continuous operation
- 80 Points
- Review the rules for what you are focusing on. It may be impossible to do all tasks, even partially, so break down the tasks, and decide for the best mix.
