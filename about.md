This site contains coding related materials. Primarily, it shares various materials I use for "Creative Coding" , an afterschool activity aiming for middle-school students.

I use the Jekyll site generator running on GitHub Pages, this provides free-of-charge hosting of a static blog. It is part of your GitHub account and available with a bit of setup effort.

Enjoy!
